# Cloudformation_app_template
Template to deploy network and servers using AWS CloudFormation for a highly available app in the cloud.

The bash scripts can be used to create or update the stacks using the .yml files and corresponding parameters.

First the network stack should be deployed, after that the server stack can be spun up!
